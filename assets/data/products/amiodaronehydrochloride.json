    "overview": "Amiodarone Hydrochloride is a white to slightly yellow crystalline powder, classified as a class III antiarrhythmic agent. It is widely used in the treatment and prevention of various types of serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. This active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) exhibits low solubility in water but is soluble in alcohol and chloroform. Amiodarone Hydrochloride is valued for its broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic action, prolonging myocardial cell-action potential duration and refractory period, thus stabilizing cardiac rhythm effectively.",
