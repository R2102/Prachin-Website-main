    "overview": "Adapalene is a synthetic retinoid-like compound presented as a white to off-white powder. It is primarily used as a topical dermatological agent for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors, modulating cell differentiation and keratinization to prevent the formation of microcomedones. With proven anti-inflammatory and comedolytic properties, it is widely recognized for its efficacy and tolerability in both short-term and long-term acne management.",
