    "overview": "Magnesium Taurate is a white, odorless, crystalline powder formed by combining magnesium with the amino sulfonic acid taurine. This compound is known for its excellent bioavailability and superior tolerability, making it a preferred magnesium source in cardiovascular and neurological health supplements. It is sparingly soluble in water and provides a synergistic effect from both magnesium and taurine.",
