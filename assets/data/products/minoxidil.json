    "overview": "Minoxidil is a white to off-white crystalline powder, originally developed as an antihypertensive vasodilator and now widely used as a topical agent for hair regrowth. It stimulates hair follicles by enhancing blood flow to the scalp and prolonging the anagen phase of the hair cycle. Minoxidil is clinically proven to be effective in treating androgenetic alopecia (pattern hair loss) in both men and women, with a well-established safety and efficacy profile across global markets.",
