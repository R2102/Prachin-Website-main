    "overview": "Acyclovir is a white crystalline powder, classified as a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with potent antiviral activity. It is widely used for the treatment of infections caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Acyclovir works by inhibiting viral DNA synthesis, thereby limiting the replication of the virus within host cells. Due to its selective activity and proven clinical efficacy, Acyclovir remains a mainstay in antiviral therapy across multiple dosage forms.",
