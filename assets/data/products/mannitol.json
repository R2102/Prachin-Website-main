    "overview": "Mannitol is a polyol (sugar alcohol) widely used as an excipient in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and food formulations. This naturally occurring substance is known for its excellent compatibility, stability, and sweetening properties, making it ideal for oral dosage forms. Mannitol appears as a white, crystalline, odorless powder with a slightly sweet taste and non-hygroscopic characteristics. Its low-calorie content and non-cariogenic nature make it suitable for diabetic-friendly products.",
